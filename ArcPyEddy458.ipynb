    "This lab took me about 14 hours to complete. This was a good introduction in terms of actually putting in to use the material we have learned so far. Their were moments of frustration but this lab made me learn useful python scripting skills. I initially did not know where to begin considering I dont have prior coding/scripting experience so it did feel a little overwhelming at first. I incorporated loops, nested loops, etc. I started off by setting up my variables for the feature classes as well as my WashingtonFIPS.dbf table.I then incorporated those variables to come up with results using cursors. The search cursors were helpful in terms of finding the relevant fields and values to answer both problems. I spoke with Luis about this lab and discussed how to tackle this lab in an efficient manner."
